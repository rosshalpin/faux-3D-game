faux 3D, colour based collisions, rotation, rudementary AI, wasd controls. 
Bill Boarded tree objects. Objects layer is sorted by y axis, in this case a faux z axis.
This allows trees to pass behind and in front of eachother while rotating, along with player and enemy objects. 
Random points for placement of trees are chosen and then occupied by a tree through colour detection of grass.
